## Advent of Code 2024
This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/) coding challenges. Each year, the event consists of 25 puzzles, one for each day in December leading up to Christmas.
As per AoC guidelines, input files used for the puzzles have been omitted from this repository, but they can be accessed directly from the official [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

### Language
For this year's challenges, I am using **C++** to solve the problems.

### Solution Overview
- **Day 1**: Focused on list sorting and iteration. Implemented basic sorting algorithms and learned more about iterating over containers in C++.
- **Day 2**: Involved recursion and sequence validation. This challenge helped me improve my understanding of recursive functions and how to validate sequences using algorithmic approaches.
- **Day 3**: Used regular expressions, string manipulation, and iteration to solve the puzzle. This was a great opportunity to explore C++'s regex library and string handling.
- **Day 4**: Focused on recursive pattern matching and working with 2D vectors. This was an interesting problem that combined recursion with the manipulation of multidimensional data structures.
