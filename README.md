## Advent of Code 2024
This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/) coding challenges. Each year, the event consists of 25 puzzles, one for each day in December leading up to Christmas.
As per AoC guidelines, input files used for the puzzles have been omitted from this repository, but they can be accessed directly from the official Advent of Code website upon login.

### Language
For this year's challenges, I am using **C++** to solve the problems.

### Solution Overview
- **Day 1**: Sorting and iterating over lists.
- **Day 2**: Recursion and sequence validation.
- **Day 3**: Regular expressions, string manipulation and iteration.
- **Day 4**: Recursive pattern matching and working with 2D vectors.
- **Day 5**: Maps and iterative search. Learned about custom sorting with lambdas (Part 2).
